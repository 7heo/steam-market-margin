## How to use

You can pass parameters to the script by adding them in the URL after a `#` (hash), and separating them with `,` (commas).

The parameters are positional.

1. The first one is either `table` or `graph`.
1. The second one is the number of datapoints to compute.
1. The third one is the number of datapoints to display, used to display the `N`th **last** datapoints. *N.B: This feature is currently only implemented with the table output.*
